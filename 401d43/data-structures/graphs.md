# Graphs

## WHAT

A graph is a non-linear data structure. It is made by connecting 'vertices' aka nodes through the use of edges. It is non-linear because nodes in a graph may have a many to many relationship with other nodes in the graph.

## HOW

There are many different ways to implement a graph. You can create a matrix which contains the edges between nodes as ordered pairs, or you can create a collection of nodes with pointers to their connecting nodes or 'neighbors'. (The second implementation is easier because it's similar to trees).

## WHY

Graphs are good for representing networks and maintaining data with complex relationships.
