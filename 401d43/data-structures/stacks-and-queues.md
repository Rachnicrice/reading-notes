# Stacks and Queues

## WHAT

A stack is a data structure where only the most recently added item may be removed (ex. last-in, first-out). A queue is a data structure where the data may only be removed in the order in which it was added (ex. first-in first-out). You can think of a stack like a stack of pancakes, and a queue like the line at chipotle.

## HOW

In a stack, items are pushed 'on top' of one another, and the next of an item in a stack is the item below it. In a queue, items are added to the back on the line, and the item in front is aware of the item behind it.

## WHY

Queues are ideal data structures when you want to maintain the order in which data was recieved. Stacks are used in recursion.
