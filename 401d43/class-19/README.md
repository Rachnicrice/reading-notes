-------------------------------------------------

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server
  The only difference is that an AWS API Gateway + Lambdas is considered serverless because it's cloud based.

2. List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each
  AWS RDL - SQL database, good for maintaining relational data.
  AWS DynamoDB - NoSQL database, good for large amounts of data and search optimization.

3. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
  FIFO queue strictly maintains ordering whereas a standard queue will consider a number of variables when delivering messeges.

4. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
  Using monitors and logs.
