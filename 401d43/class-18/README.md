# Readings: AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda
-------------------------------------------------

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What are serverless functions?
  Serverless functions are small, single-purpose functions that live on the cloud.

2. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
  Not quite sure how to answer this. I guess I'd just create an API endpoint that triggered some code? Make all routes automatically go through this endpoint?

3. Describe how a CDN works
  A CDN is a network of interconnected servers, existing in different geographical locations that work together to deliver content quickly and efficiently.

### Vocabulary Terms

Serverless Functions - A function created for a single purpose that is hosted on the cloud.

Cloud Storage - A virtual storage system that can be accessed over the internet.

CDN - Content Deliver Network.

### Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
  - Cloud Storage
  - Lambda
  - 
2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
  - Severless Functions
  - DynamoDB
  - API Gateways
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
  - I'm looking forward to implementing our our API Gateways. This is a term I heard a lot at Zillow but wasn'y exactly sure how it was different from an API endpoint.
