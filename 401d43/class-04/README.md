# Readings: Data Modeling
-------------------------------------------------

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

  - High test coverage
  - Easier to maintain (code-decoupling)
  - More modular (one feature is designed at a time)

2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

  Use before each if you need to mock data before each test. Use after each to make sure you're starting each test with a clean slate.

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development

  Can be a slower process, because you have to write the tests, then code, then refactor.

4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

5. Why REST?
  
    It can handle multiple types of calls. Works with json, xml and plain text. Lots of flexibility since data is not tied to resources or methods.

### Vocabulary Terms

functional programming - A declarative programming style where the primary focus is 'what to solve'. Generally used expressions over statements.
object-oriented programming (OOP) - A programming paradign where all code is modeled after and organized into Objects.
class - A class is a template to create objects, it defines data types/values and methods on the object
super - The parent class of a sub-class
this - A reference to an object (usually a reference to the current object ex. 'this' object)
Test Driven Development (TDD) - A style of programming where tests are written before code development
Jest - A javascript testing framework.
Continuous Integration (CI) - The practice of merging changes to a main development branch as new code is developed.
REST - Representational State Transfer
Data Model - A model representing how sets of data relate to each other.

### Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
  - REST
  - TDD
  - Jest
2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
  - ES6 Classes
  - SQL Modeling techniques
  - 
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
  - Classes, I love OOP!!
