# Readings: Redux - Additional Topics
-------------------------------------------------

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
  I'm still not sure what Redux "Ducks" is.

2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
  "Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code." - https://redux.js.org/redux-toolkit/overview#:~:text=Redux%20Toolkit%20makes%20it%20easier,of%20skill%20level%20or%20experience.

### Vocabulary Terms

redux toolkit slices - A function that will automatically generate action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. Accepts 3 arguments initial state, an object full of reducer functions and a slice name.

namespace - A namespace is a group of related elements kept together under one unique identifier. This practice prevents naming collisions between libraries/packeges.
