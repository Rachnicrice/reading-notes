# Readings: AWS: S3 and Lambda
-------------------------------------------------

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe “The Cloud”
  A collection of computer servers that are accessed over the internet.

2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
 A container packages up code and all its dependencies so that it can be run in different envoirnments. (Ex. Docker)

3. What is auto-scaling?
  Auto-scaling is the process of dynamically adjusting computational resources.

4. What is bandwidth?
  The maximum rate of data that can be transferred across any given connection.

5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?
  Based on the amount of computational resources/bandwidth required.

### Vocabulary Terms

Server Instances - A single instance of server software running on a physical or virtual server.

Containers - A bucket for code and it's dependencies.

Cloud Services - A collection of services offered by servers that can be accessed over the internet.

Cloud Architecture - The way technology components combine to build an accessible virtual envoirnment.

AWS - Amazon Web Service

EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku - EC2/Beanstalk are hosted by AWS. Heroku is better for sandboxing w/o risk of getting charged.
