# Readings: Event Driven Architecture
-------------------------------------------------

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
  FIFO ensures that messages are sent in a first-in/first-out order, standard queue does not.

2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
  Based on a client response.

3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
  Async architecture.

4. How do you test an event driven system?
  Mock the firing of events I would assume.

### Vocabulary Terms

Pub/Sub - Publisher and Subscriber
