# Readings: Event Driven Applications
-------------------------------------------------

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is access control important?  
Access control is important to make sure that user's can only perform allowed actions. Ex. a regular user can't go around deleting other people's accounts or changing their information.

2. Describe an application that would need access control.  
Almost any application with more that one user would need access control. 

3. What is a role used for?
A role is used to indicate what permissions/access control level a user has.

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
Because a role can be applied to groups of users.

### Vocabulary Terms

Authorization - A security indicator which determines user access levels/privileges.  

Role Based Access Control - An approach to restricting system access to authorized users where permissions are defined in role groups.  

Capabilities - A token of authority.
